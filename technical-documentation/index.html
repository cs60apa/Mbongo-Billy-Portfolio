                <p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language. It is used to improve website or webpage
                    functionality. Also, it is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create responsive
                    websites.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript is one of many client side-scripting languages (e.g., VBScript, PerlScript,
                    Jscript, ActionScript) that exist in the web. However, it is the most popular and widely
                    used. Due to its wide usage, it has spawned multiple frameworks. Frameworks are there to
                    make coding easier. They also improve and enhance the functionality of languages.
                    JavaScript frameworks will be discussed in the later parts of this book.

                        function greetMe(your name) {
                            alert("hello" + yourname); 
                        }
                        greetMe("world");

                <p>Variables are storage entities within a program. They store information that will be used
                    later on the program. It makes tracking of useful and crucial values in a script easier. Also,
                    it makes it easier to use a value repeatedly, without remembering and typing the value
                    exactly every time you need it.
                    n the English language, variables are like pronouns. For example, your noun is “John”.
                    To make it easier to refer to him, you can just use the pronoun he, him, or his in your
                    sentences. That is just how simple variable works. Of course, other uses can be
                    incorporated with variables.
                </p>

                <p>On the other hand, you must be already familiar with term variable. After all, your
                    Mathematics teacher should have mentioned it a lot when you were in high school; you
                    would have encountered it in college as well.
                    The concept of variables in Math is similar with JavaScript variables or variables in
                    programming — with a few notable differences. First, variables in programming do not

                        {
                            var x = 10;
                        }
                        console.log(x);

            <article>
                <p>Functions are grouped lines of codes that do not immediately run when the browser parses
                    them. Unlike regular lines of codes and conditional statements, the statements within a
                    function are executed when the function is invoked.
                </p>
                <p>They are especially useful in decluttering your source code and making it more readable.
                    Also, its primary use is to organize your code and minimize the lines of codes you need to
                    type, especially if you need to execute the code block multiple times. After all, functions
                    can be invoked as many times as you want.
                    Here is an example of a JavaScript function:
                    > function exampleFunction() {
                    alert(“This is a function.”);
                    }
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        function btn9() {
                            document.getElementByid('input-box').value += 9
                        }
                    </code>

            <header>Data type</header>
            <article>
                <p>In programming, manipulation of data is imminent. What is data anyway? Data is
                    information. It can be in form of numbers or text. Aside from text and numbers, JavaScript
                    can also process other forms of data types such as arrays and objects.
                </p>
                <p>Why is there a classification of data? It is to make the language and functions as clear and
                    clean as possible. Also, it compartmentalizes the usage of operators. For example, there is
                    no way you can multiple texts
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        var name1= "this is a string"; <br>
                        var num2= 0;<br>
                        let num3=3.0;

            <header>While statement</header>
            <article>
                <p>Another statement that you can use in JavaScript is the while statement. The while loop is like an
                    advanced version of the for loop that encourages users to customize their statement. Unlike for
                    loop, the while statement only requires a condition to run. For example
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code> 
                        var n = 0; <br>
                        var n = 0; 
                        <br>
                        while (n < 3) { <br>
                                n++;
                                x += n;
                        }

        <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
            <header>If else statement</header>
            <article>
                <p>To get more control of the conditions you created, you can use else if statements. Else if
                    statements are else statements combined with another condition. You can use it in
                    conjunction with other ifs and else statements. For example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        if (condition1) { <br>
                            statement1;
                            else if (condition2) {<br>
                                statement2; <br>
                            }
                            else if(conditionN) { <br>
                                statementN; <br>
                            }
                            else { <br>
                                statementlast; <br>
                            }
                        }
